Agent License Status Warnings
When user is working with a property in darwin Cloud, there is an easy way to see when some agents license is expired.
This wasn't possible in darwin Citrix. But, in darwin Cloud, there's a setting you can change and it changes the display on screens throughout the software. Now, when some agent's license is out of date, user will see the warning right on the screen.
There may be many different license types to track. Some of the licenses (like drivers license) may not be so important. But other licenses, like their real estate license, are critical. And it may be illegal in your state to issue a commission check to an agent with an expired license.
So with darwin Cloud, no matter how many licenses you are tracking on each agent and broker, you can set which licenses are most important for the closing staff to monitor. Then, as they work, darwin Cloud will notify them every time they are working with a file that includes an agent with an expired license.
To change the settings in darwin Cloud of which expired licenses to monitor
Click Dropdowns menu
Click People submenu
Click License type from the right side of the screen
Check the box/es which expired licenses to be monitored
Click save after the modification


Agents with expired licenses will be shown in orange font color.

How Do I Display Payee Address on Checks?
There are two settings that determine whether the address is pulled by the merge field:
address type - must be Mailing
this is next mailing address - address will NOT print if this box is checked


To add or review a payee's mailing address:
Go to People
Go to People basics
To add an address, click the plus (+) button
To edit an existing address, click the address
Set address type to Mailing
Ensure "this is next mailing address" is not checked
Click save


Contacts can have only one address of each address type on their profile. If the contact already has an address of type Mailing, the address type of the existing record must be changed before a different address of type Mailing can be added.
Setup Required on Checks
There are five address merge fields available for check layout to allow users flexibility in the way the address displays on the check.
Each merge field includes one or more lines of the address.  See image below as a reference for the text included in address lines 1, 2, and 3.


 
Option 1: {PayeeFullAddressFormatted}
This merge field includes all text from all three lines of the payee's mailing address, and displays it in a conventional format.  
Note: Because this merge field dynamically expands to include two or three rows of text as needed, make sure to size the merge field correctly when adding it to a check layout. A field height of at least 75 is recommended to accommodate addresses with an apt/suite or floor number.




Option 2: {payeeStreetAddressWithAptFloor} + {payeeCityStateZip}
The  {payeeStreetAddressWithAptFloor} merge field includes all fields from the first two lines of the payee's street address, including any apartment or floor details.  This merge field displays the text as one line to save space.
The {payeeCityStateZip} merge field includes the city, state, and zip code of the payee's mailing address




Option 3: {payeeStreetAddress} + {payeeAptNumFloorNum} + {payeeCityStateZip}
In this setup, the Payee Address is broken into three separate merge fields on check templates:
{payeeStreetAddress} - displays the fields street number, direction, street name, street designation and suffix
{payeeAptNumFloorNum} - displays text entered in the fields apt/suite number and floor number
{payeeCityStateZip} - displays the fields city, state, and zip




The merge fields that include the second line of the address display only the text typed into the "apt/suite number" and "floor number" fields for the payee's address. To display "Apt 3" or "Suite 15," make sure to type the full designation and not only the number.
This affects the fields {payeeAptNumFloorNum}, {payeeStreetAddressWithAptFloor}, and {PayeeFullAddressFormatted}

Select your custom total when running a report
When you run your report, under the available columns look for the Custom Totals and select the name of the total that needs to show on the report.
Note that the custom totals will not show the data for each agent if it was just added. If you would like the totals to show the data on the report, manually run the rep cubes with full update or wait until the next day as darwin Cloud does an automatic update on rep cubes every midnight.


When your report appears, the name that you gave to the Total will appear as a column header in your report

















Give Team Leaders Permission to View Team Member Production
When Team Leaders need access to the production numbers of their Team Members, these permissions can be set up in darwin Cloud and will allow expanded access to specific reports in the sytem.

Search for the agent using the magnifying glass. Click here for instructions on How to Search for an Agent
Locate the person id below the agent's name


Once the Team Leader's person id is known:

Team Leader Access
For most darwin Cloud users with Agent permissions, reports will automatically filter by Agent to exclude information and production data associated with other agents. When a user with Agent permissions are set up as a Team Leader, this allows the user to view reports filtered by Team instead of by Agent.
This expanded access is currently available for the report Closings by Agent, and can be added to additional reports upon request (pending approval by AccountTECH's programming team).  To submit a request, please email support@accounttech.com.

Name
Mailing Address
Tax ID (for vendors)

Verify Agent Mailing address
Agent contact information is located on the People basics submenu. For agents and vendors receiving a 1099 under their given name:
Confirm first name
Confirm last name
Confirm address is correct, and that address type is mailing

Enter Personal Tax ID or Corporate Tax ID
While there is only one tax ID type available for vendors, agents may use either the personal tax ID or corporate tax ID field.
For agents not using a corporate name for taxes, the personal tax ID field must be filled in.
For agents who use a corporate name for taxes, the corporate tax ID field must be filled in.
If using the corporate tax ID, the incorporation date should be filled in
The dissolution date can be used if an agent reverts from using their corporate tax ID to their personal tax ID


How does darwin Cloud determine which tax ID to apply to vouchers?
The personal tax ID field is used for all agents who do not use a corporate name.
The corporate tax ID field is an option for agents who use a corporate name.  If it is left blank, darwin Cloud will default to using the personal tax ID (if filled in).  This optional field was designed to allow users to easily split an agent's earnings between a personal and corporate 1099 based on the date on which the agent Incorporated or disincorporated.  The corporate tax ID will be applied to vouchers that are dated between the incorporation date and the  dissolution date (if applicable).
The incorporation date indicates the date from which the agents earnings should be taxed under their corporate tax ID.
The dissolution date date indicates the date after which the agents earnings should be taxed under their personal tax ID.
For agents who use a corporate name for taxes, if the personal tax ID field is filled in and the corporate tax ID field is blank, darwin Cloud will automatically default to using the personal tax ID when generating 1099's
Please note that if an agent is NOT using a corporate name but the profile includes only a corporate tax ID, a 1099 will not be generated for the individual in order to prevent incorrect tax reporting.
Tax ID Security Settings and Access
When you enter the tax id value, it is displayed as ***-**-****. For security reasons, the 1099 value is hidden from most users.  Only darwin Cloud users with special 1099 security clearance are allowed to view the tax ID.

Click the lock icon to view or edit the tax id field


To grant users access to the tax ID field:

a new window will appear, enter the username to locate
Check the box for 1099 TaxID

No or Invalid Agents Sent
Causes:
There are a few factors that can cause this issue.  The main causes are:
List agent is missing on a listing (or list side of in-house transaction), or the sell agent is missing on a sale transaction (or sell side of an in-house transaction)
The transaction is flagged as in-house when it is only a one-sided deal
One or more agents on the deal are in Terminated status, or are missing a sales role
Scenario 1: List agent or Sell agent missing from one-side or in-house transaction
This error is quick to fix for a single transaction, but because it is usually caused by an error in the agent's setup, it is worth taking a few extra minutes to follow the steps in the prevention section as well.
To fix the error:
Click Properties menu
Click search
a new window will appear, fill in accordingly
Click none hyperlink to add missing agent
Confirm the list agent (or sell agent), depending on the appropriate side
a new window will appear, fill in accordingly
Click save
Click submit


Prevention
The first step in preventing this error is confirming the source of the transaction - MLS, or manual addition.
Click History
Scroll to the bottom of the page
Find the change type, New property
Check if modified by is dwinner
Note: dwinner indicates an update made by one of AccountTECH's feeds


For transactions imported from MLS, the underlying cause for missing list or sell agents is generally a missing or incorrect MLS ID on the agent's profile. 
To add a missing MLS ID:
Click People menu
Click search
a new window will appear, fill in accordingly
Click People links
Click + to add a new MLS ID
Select MLS type source
Select the subtype
Enter MLS ID
Click add


To edit an incorrect MLS ID:
Click People menu
Click search
a new window will appear, fill in accordingly
Click People links
Click the MLS ID to be be modified
Confirm or fix MLS source
Click save


Additional Considerations:
For companies with multiple integrations set up (ex. SkySlope, DotLoop, etc.), there may be other feeds that need to be reviewed.  If the agent's MLS ID is correct and the error is occurring in another feed, please contact support@accounttech.com for further assistance.
Scenario 2: The transaction is flagged as in-house when it is only a one-sided deal
Fix:
A transaction is classified as In-House when both the list agent and sell agent boxes on the Property Basics screen are checked.  If the box for the list or sell side is checked and no agent name is supplied, this can cause a submission error.
Click Properties menu
Click search
a new window will appear, fill in accordingly
Click Agents submenu
Click on the empty field next to agent's name to be deleted
Click delete


Prevention:
The most common cause for this error is the Cancel settings on the Settings > Settings screen.  By default, no information from the buyer side of a transaction should be copied to a re-activated listing.  However, because the settings can be customized, there are configurations that will copy the sell agent flag to the new record when the transaction is reactivated.  This can occur during auto-cancel (when a transaction is updated from Pending to Active in MLS), or when a transaction is manually cancelled.
To adjust the settings:
Click Settings menu
Click Setup submenu
Click application settings tab
Select the section Cancel property
Locate Fields to copy from property, click select items...
Scroll to ourSell, and deselect the checkbox
Click ok
Click save


Additional Considerations:
The steps above will prevent the Sell Agent checkbox from populating when an in-house transaction has been reactivated.  If other buyer side fields are also set to copy on reactivated transactions, deselecting those items from the Cancel property settings will prevent them from copying going forward.
Other items to review include sellingPrice, sellCommission, and sellCommRate.
Scenario 3: One or more agents on the deal are in Terminated status, or missing a sales role
Terminated Agents:
Since transactions can only submit successfully if all agents on the deal are active, any agents who are no longer active with the company must be temporarily restored to status active before the transaction will submit successfully.  Terminated agents will display as red on property records.
Missing Sales Role:
Only transactions with an active Sales Role, (such as Sales Associate), can be submitted successfully on property records.  Agents with missing sales roles will not appear differently on the property record, but can be identified when their profile is reviewed.
To fix errors caused by an agent's status or roles:
Click Properties menu
Click search
a new window will appear, fill in accordingly
Click Agents submenu
Click agent's name to jump to the agent's profile
Note: Terminated agents will display in red, making them easy to identify


For Terminated Agents:
On the agent's profile:
Click Agent basics
Check the active checkbox
Remove terminated date from profile
Click the position
Remove terminated date from position
Click save on position window
Click save on profile
Click submit


For agents missing active sales roles:
On agent's profile:
Click Agent Basics
note that several of the agent tabs below are grayed out - this indicates that the profile is classified as an Employee rather than an Agent
Click the plus (+) button next to positions to add an active sales role
Select the role Sales Associate
Select the office
Enter start date
Click add
Click submit


After the agent(s) on the deal have been reviewed and corrected as needed:
Click Properties
Click submit


For terminated agents, the terminated status may need to be restored after the transaction has submitted successfully.  To restore the terminated status:
Click People menu
Click search
a new window will appear, fill in accordingly
Click Agent Basics submenu
Uncheck the active checkbox
Add terminated date to profile
Click the position
Add terminated date to position
Click save on position window
Click save on profile
Click submit


Prevention:
The best way to prevent these errors going forward is:
Track terminated agents who have transactions in Pending status - closing out these deals will require following the steps above
Ensure that staff members who set up new agents are familiar with the agent positions that qualify as sales roles for your franchise.  The position Sales Associate is a sales role for all brands, but the position Sales Agent is classified by Anywhere Real Estate Inc. as a non-agent employee role.

How to Setup Transaction Fees Collected from Agents
If transaction fees are collected from the seller and buyer in addition to the commission, it is often the case that the agent has to pay the fees if they do not collect them from the seller or buyer.
A very typical use case is that the office has some fixed amount the agents should collect (this may vary per agent) and the agent is only charged if the amount they collected is less than the minimum determined by the office.
